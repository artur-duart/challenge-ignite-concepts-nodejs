# Challenge 01: Concepts of Node.js

This is my repository for Rocketseat Challenge 01, where I'm testing my knowledge of Node.js and creating an application to manage tasks (*todos*).

## About the challenge

In this application, I need to be able to create a user with `name` and `username` and CRUD of *todos*:

- Create a new *todo*;
- List all *todos*;
- Change the `title` and `deadline` of an existing *todo*;
- Mark a *todo* as done;
- Delete a *todo*;
